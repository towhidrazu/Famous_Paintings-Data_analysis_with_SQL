# Famous_Paintings-Data_analysis_with_SQL
Answering several questions using SQL queries from Paintaings data

***Little background: Recently, I visited the Museum of Natural Sciences at the University of Saskatchewan. On the same day, after returning home, I opened YouTube and came across a video from the famous TechTFQ channel. The video focused on paintings and museum data analysis using SQL. The dataset included information about various paintings displayed in museums worldwide. The analysis involved answering a handful of questions using SQL queries. Given my recent museum visit, I found a connection to the content and decided to recreate the project, intending to add it to my portfolio.***


**Dataset is taken from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/famous-paintings**

In this project, under the folder of 'datasets' we have 8 numbers of CSV files. We have to import those CSV files into our postgreSQL. To do that easily we will use python programming language. We will use 'pandas' and 'sqlalchemy' library of python. Pandas is a very popular python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data. SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL. 

To install pandas and sqlalchemy in our project area at windows pc, procedures are followd shown in this YouTube video: https://youtu.be/6WW7J7Hhw8c?si=Gj7W-OTMRtQsXV2X

Then we will create a database in postgreSQL named 'paintaings' where we will load our CSV files.

Now on Visual Studio code we will run the following codes to create 8 new tables from 8 CSV files under paintaings database.
