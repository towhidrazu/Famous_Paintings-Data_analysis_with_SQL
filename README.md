# Famous_Paintings-Data_analysis_with_SQL
Answering several questions using SQL queries from Paintaings data

***Little background: Recently, I visited the Museum of Natural Sciences at the University of Saskatchewan. On the same day, after returning home, I opened YouTube and came across a video from the famous TechTFQ channel. The video focused on paintings and museum data analysis using SQL. The dataset included information about various paintings displayed in museums worldwide. The analysis involved answering a handful of questions using SQL queries. Given my recent museum visit, I found a connection to the content and decided to recreate the project, intending to add it to my portfolio.***


**Dataset is taken from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/famous-paintings**

In this project, under the folder of 'datasets' we have 8 numbers of CSV files. We have to import those CSV files into our postgreSQL. To do that easily we will use python programming language. We will use pandas, a very popular python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.

To install pandas in our project area at windows pc procedures are followd shown in this YouTube video: https://youtu.be/6WW7J7Hhw8c?si=Gj7W-OTMRtQsXV2X
